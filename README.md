# Yardi website test Read Me file
This website was both challenging and fun.
I tried to use as much Bootstrap and CSS Grid as possible.
Somethings I had to use plain old CSS3 to get it to match up as close as possible.

I hope they liked the job I did. With my trip for the holiday weekend I only had 4 days to complete it when I got back.
I did get some DD done over the weekend festivities. getting a deeper understanding of Bootstrap 5 is fun. It is an amazing tool for creating websites.
I look forward to getting a deeper understanding all it's tools.
